## Download current version
[0.4](https://github.com/ArturSkowronski/keeptron/releases/tag/v0.4-alpha) 

##Intent behind Keeptron
[Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) is awesome note-taking app. Still, as majority Google products, it's not suited for work with desktop environment in any sensible way. 

Inspired by great Evernote Helper, I decided to create Electron application (Keep, as majority Google products, don't have any API...). It's still can be consider as Alpha Release, but due to rule "it's null until you ship it", I decided it's time to let people test it. 

Application is fully OS, relesed on MIT Licence. It can be downloaded from [Releases Section](https://github.com/ArturSkowronski/keeptron/releases).  

It's my first Electron application, so please feel free to point any issues! The more, the better!

Version for Windows/Linux will be created as soon as application feature set will be stabilized.
